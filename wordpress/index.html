                What is optimization and why is it needed?</h2>
            <div class="optimization_text">
                There are countless active and even abandoned sites on the Internet. Most of them coincide not only in
                categories, but also in content.
                <br><br>
                Imagine thousands of sites that provide the same information in one way or another or sell the same
                service. And you can get to these sites only by thematic queries in search engines.
                <br><br>
                But what should you do if your site looks like a hundred or a thousand of the same, and there are only
                10 positions on one Google or Yandex page? How to bring visitors to your resource page? This is exactly
                what optimization is for - to bring your site to the first search page!
                <br><br>
                <span>We will teach you how to make your site attractive to search engines and advise you on how to get it to
                    the first pages, bypassing all competitors.</span>
